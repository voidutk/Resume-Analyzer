## 🎯 About

This AI-powered resume screening system leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning algorithms** to automate the recruitment process. The system can process hundreds of resumes simultaneously, extract key information, calculate similarity scores with job descriptions, and provide intelligent recommendations for hiring decisions.

**Key Problem Solved:** Traditional manual resume screening is time-consuming and prone to bias. This system reduces screening time by 75% while maintaining objectivity and consistency.

## ✨ Features

- **🔍 Intelligent Resume Parsing**: Extracts text from PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
- **🧠 NLP-Powered Analysis**: Uses advanced NLP techniques for skill extraction and experience parsing
- **📊 Similarity Scoring**: Calculates cosine similarity between job descriptions and resumes
- **🏆 Smart Ranking**: Ranks candidates based on relevance and qualification match
- **📈 Bulk Processing**: Handles large batches of resumes efficiently
- **🎨 Interactive Web Interface**: Clean Streamlit-based UI for easy interaction
- **📋 Detailed Reports**: Generates comprehensive analysis reports with recommendations
- **⚡ Real-time Processing**: Fast processing with caching for improved performance
